# Suspicious Acitivity Recognition

**Smart India Hackathon 2020 (MAIT Internal Winner)**
HawkEye is a Suspicious Activity Recognition platform that uses the C3D Model to to extract the features from a video file followed by the activity recognition using a Standard Vector Machine (SVM). The Technological stack is built in Python 3 using standard Machine Learning and Computer Vision Libraries
